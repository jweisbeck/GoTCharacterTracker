## Concept
A browseable compendium that lets users learn about and explore the story arcs of GoT characters. The characters are at the center of the app. Users would start by picking a character. From there they could explore a character's journey through the story, study family relationships, track encounters with other GoT figures, and learn about important belongings, etc. 

This is GoT fan site of sorts. But what would make it different is users could fill in character details, making it a rich compendium of GoT character knowledge. I'd want the focus to be on the HBO series, simply because it's a much simpler, easier amount of work to tackle. The value of the app is that users who love the TV show, but can't keep up with everything happening, can use this as a resouce to enrich their viewing experience.

Notably, this compendium will not have a strong connection to the structure of the plot or TV series. I want the characters to be the hub of the experience, not procedure or plot. This approach also helps guard against the compendium becoming a raft of spoiler alerts. It's true that revealing encounters between characters and plotting someone's progress on a map may give away too much, but it wouldn't spoil the story or take away from the enjoyment of waching characters develop.
